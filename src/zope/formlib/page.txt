Pages
=====

This is an experimental facility for defining pages in Python.

A page is a view that's implemented in Python and registered in ZCML.

The goal of pages is to put definitions in Python, rather than in
ZCML.

Pages are simply objects that implement views.  There are a number of
mix-in classes that make this easier.

There are different kinds of pages:

- Adapters, which provide some interface

- Pages, which provide published objects

What are the sorts of facilities we need?

- Browser Publishing -- A browser-published object needs to provide
  IBrowserPublisher.

- Widget management

  - Widget set up

    - We can set up widgets for input, editing, or display

      - select widget type

      - initialize widgets with existing data in edit case

  - Input processing

 - Actions/buttons 

A major goal is to make creating pages simple and explicit

Creating simple pages
=====================

To create a page, which is an object that is published as a page, 
you need to provide an object that:

- has a __call__ method and that

- provides IBrowserPublisher, and

If ZPT is going to be used, then your object should also provide
request and context attributes.

The Page base class provides a standard constructor
and a simple implementation of IBrowserPublisher:

    >>> import zope.formlib
    >>> class MyPage(zope.formlib.Page):
    ...     pass

    >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> context = object()
    >>> page = MyPage(context, request)

    >>> from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser import IBrowserPublisher
    >>> IBrowserPublisher.providedBy(page)
    True

    >>> page.browserDefault(request) == (page, ())
    True

    >>> page.publishTraverse(request, 'bob') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotFound: Object: <MyPage object at ...>, name: 'bob'

    >>> page.request is request
    True

    >>> page.context is context
    True

But it doesn't supply a __call__ method:

    >>> page()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: 'MyPage' object is not callable

It is the subclass' responsibility to do that.

If we want to use a page template, we will normally store that
template in a file and use a ViewPageTemplateFile to add it to a
class:

    >>> from zope.app.pagetemplate import ViewPageTemplateFile
    >>> class MyPage(zope.formlib.Page):
    ...     __call__ = ViewPageTemplateFile('sample.pt')

(See sample.pt in this directory to see the sample template.)

Now, we'll create a content object and use it with our new page:

    >>> class MyContent:
    ...     def __init__(self, name):
    ...         self.name = name

    >>> context = MyContent('bob')

    >>> page = MyPage(context, request)
    >>> print page(1, 2, x=3, y=4)
    <html><body>
    Hello bob
    The URL is http://127.0.0.1
    The positional arguments were (1, 2)
    The keyword argument x is 3
    </body></html>
    <BLANKLINE>
